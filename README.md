# Starship Adventure

### Description
This program chooses 7 rooms at random from a bank of 10 and creates an adventure game from them. The program creates connections between the rooms at random, each room with at least 3 connections and at most 6 connections. The program then randomly selects a starting room and an ending room. The goal of the game is to traverse the rooms by their connections, navigating from the starting room to the ending room. Once the user has successfully reached the ending room, the program prints the path they took through the rooms to victory and how many steps they took.
